# SnakeSocks [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SnakeSocks/snakesocks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SnakeSocks/snakesocks)

SnakeSocks is a fast tunnel proxy to make accessing Internet through firewall more secure.

You can write your own module to make your packets "seems" like anything.

Due to our test, it may have less latency but smaller bandwidth than sha*owsocks.

Tip: 'client' is 'client for linux/unix' if not specially instructed.

## WARNING: Snakesocks 1.4.0 Changed the API, so sksrv with version<1.4.0 doesn't work anymore. See CHANGELOG.md

## Dependencies

- Runtime

glibc 2.14

- Compilation

C++14 support and C++ Boost Library (client), Golang (server)

## Install from release

Download and unpack snakesocks from [here](https://github.com/snakesocks/snakesocks/releases), then run `./install.sh client/server`.

Client for windows will be released together with snakesocks-windows-gui, at [here](https://github.com/snakesocks/snakesocks-windows).

## Build from source

- Setup your compilation environment quickly

```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gccgo-go libboost-system-dev cmake make git
# CentOS/RedHat > Tip: edit software version number if they've been updated.
sudo yum install go make boost148-devel boost148-static git centos-release-scl && sudo yum install devtoolset-7-gcc-c++ # Tip: you can provide gcc7 in other way if you prefer.
sudo ln -s /usr/include/boost148/boost /usr/include/boost && sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/boost148/libboost_system.a /usr/lib/libboost_system.a # So that cmake can find boost.
curl https://cmake.org/files/v3.10/cmake-3.10.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xvzf - && export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/cmake-3.10.2-Linux-x86_64/bin/ # cmake in yum repo is too old.
export SKCLI_CC=/opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin/cc && export SKCLI_CXX=/opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/bin/c++ # Providing gcc6/7/8 here is OK.
# ArchLinux
sudo pacman -S gcc go boost cmake make git
```

- Build client

```sh
git clone https://github.com/snakesocks/snakesocks.git
cd snakesocks
make client
make default_modules
sudo make install
skcli -h
```

- Build server

```sh
git clone https://github.com/snakesocks/snakesocks.git
cd snakesocks
make server
make default_modules
sudo make install
sksrv -h
```

- Client for windows (mingw)

Refer to [here](https://github.com/snakesocks/snakesocks-windows) please.

## Install and use modules

1. copy the .so module file to `/etc/snakesocks/modules/` or wherever you like.
2. change the corresponding configuration to the path of the .so file.
3. make sure the server and the client use the same module.

## Build your module from source

```shell
cd src/modules
make <module_name>
# and the corresponding .so file will be generated.
# omit <module_name> will build the default destination.
```

## Write your own module

### Develop

1. Read `stdafx.h` `conn.h` `bss.h` `client_query.h` for specifications of module APIs.
2. Read `simple_proxy` and `se_proxy` implementation for examples of module implementation.
3. Write your own module.

### Test

```shell
# first,modify Makefile to add your module builds
# follow examples of se_proxy and simple_proxy
# then, modify config.mk to set your default build destination.
# then run
make test
./test
# to run the test program we provided to test the module you write
```

## Configuration

SnakeSocks has its configuration files in `/etc/snakesocks/conf`. Just edit `client.conf` or `server.conf` to fit your demand.

The client and the server should use the same module, unless you're really clear about what you're doing.

## Optimize

Usually, tcpbbr or kcptun is useful to improve connection stability.
