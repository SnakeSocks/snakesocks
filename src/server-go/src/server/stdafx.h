 * You must NEVER try to edit binary_safe_string inside connect_info. Regard them as const char * please.
 *
 * For `client_deal_auth_reply`:

 *
 * For `client_encode` and `client_decode`:
 * You can either malloc/calloc a new binary_safe_string to return and free `data`, or edit `data` and return it.
 * I'll free returned string only once, and never free `data` passed to client_(en/de)code.

// functions behind this comment is the next api to be implemented and used in
// protocol definition on snakesocks.
// will not be implemented in a short time, but once it can be correctly accessed
// by the main program of snakesocks, this comment will be removed.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// the foundamental idea of apis provided behind is : to provide more widely ranged
// control of the protocol we use to communicating between the server and client.
// In the first snakesocks c/s version, we forced network packs to have an leading
// "size" to ensure all specified strings to be decoded correctly.
// But in the following version, which is the following apis will apply on,
// the users can have fully control on how we define a "package".
// for example, you can use "terminating octet serial" instead of "leading size number"
// to divide a stream into packages(like HTTP protocol does).
// Even if you found that's a bad idea, there are solutions for you to control how
// we encode the "leading size number"(in the current version, we just sent it barely),
// and the length of it.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// note: the appending work(append terminating octets to data to be sent) will be done automatically by us

// API : check terminating octet serial
// explain: this process will work like the following:
// the server/client will read data byte by byte, and first put one byte in the second parameter;
// then check your return value:
// on -1: not correct. the data in octet_serial will be seen as part of package data.
//        contents in the octet_serial will be storaged by us and will not appear again in next call.
// on  0: correct but not complete. that means the data in octet_serial assembled a part of terminating
//        serial. we will append next byte we read in it and retry this api until hit a return of -1 or 1.
// on  1: terminated. that means the data in octet serial fully matched with the terminating octet serial
//        defined by you. the data in octet_serial will be discarded and the data saved before will be
//        treated as a completed package.

// API : assemble the size number:
